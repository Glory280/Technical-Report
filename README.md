# Technical Report: Initial Review of Sales Data

### Introduction
The dataset sales_data_sample.csv comprises sales transactions with various attributes, including order details, customer information, and product categories. This report provides a preliminary review of the dataset, highlighting obvious patterns, trends, or anomalies. The aim is to gain initial insights that can guide more in-depth analysis.

### Observations
This is a vehicle sales and delivery dataset within the span of three 3 years. It consists of columns having customer information, date and time information, geographic distribution, sales performance and product information which can be used for data analysis. 

### Steps To be Carried Out
- Data Cleaning: This will involve checking and handling missing values and coverting values into the correct datatype.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This will involve analysing sales trend over time, analysing geographical distribution, performing sales analysis using product line and deal size and investigating order status to identify patterns in cancellations and delays.
- 

- Visualizing Findings: This will involve creating visualizations to show key finding from the data

### Initial Insights
- Product Line Performance:
Classic cars had the highest quantity ordered, while trains had the least quantity ordered.

)

- Temporal Trends:
2004 had the highest quantity ordered, followed by 2003, with 2005 having the least quantity ordered.

### Conclusion
This initial review of the sales_data_sample.csv dataset reveals several promising avenues for detailed analysis. Classic cars are the most popular product line, and 2004 was the peak year for sales in terms of quantity ordered. The delivery status data indicates a high rate of successful shipments, with a relatively small number of cancelled or disputed orders. Geographically, the USA is the dominant market, while Ireland has the lowest sales volume.

Moving forward, more detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques will be employed to uncover deeper insights and patterns in the data. This preliminary review sets the stage for targeted investigations that can inform business strategies and operational improvements.
